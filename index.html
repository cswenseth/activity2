	<p>Hello!</p>
	
	<p>My name is Charles Swenseth. I am a senior Management Information Systems student seeking graduation in December 2020. Pictured above is me: Charles, my wife: Dayna, and our daughter: Charlotte. This picture was taken in May 2018, at my wife's third fourth graduation ceremony. This particular degree was for her masters. She also has a high school diploma, an associates degree, and a bachelors degree. She'll also be done with her doctorate next year. Needless to say, I have some catching up to do.</p>
	
	<p>I currently work as an IT and Facilities coordinator for an organization in Lincoln, NE. This job primarily involves monitoring potential issues and responding accordingly. Upon completion of this spring semester, I intend to explore graduate programs to continue my education. </p>
	
    <p>On the left, there is a "Family" link. There, you can see some more recent pictures of us.</p>
